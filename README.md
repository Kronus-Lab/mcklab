# Minecraft Modpack - Kronus Lab

Welcome To Kronus' Lab

In this modpack, your adventure begins on a simple sky island with the very basic needs to survive a few days and start your empire. To achieve your goals, you will gain access to a treasure trove of technological tools.

Starting with Ex Nihilo: Sequentia, you will gather the various resources you will need on your adventure. At some point, you will want to increase the rate at which you get resources and getting more sieves won't be feasible. In this case, this pack has a solution for you in the form of Mystical Agriculture. It will allow you to create seeds for the various resources in the pack and grow them like you do wheat.

But wait, what about automating my farm? Well For that CC: Tweaked will come to the rescue if you prefer the traditional fields of crops, but if you prefer more dense areas, Botany Pots and Botany Trees might be your bread and butter, figuratively speaking of course. While these are great mods to get resources, who speaks automation, speaks processing and for this, this modpack provides tech in the form of multi-block constructions, starting with Immersive Engineering. As your power hunger grows and cause damage to your eardrums by listening to the constant hum of diesel generators or from the burning of fuel in your Advanced Generators, you start to think about green energy and by green i mean uranium of course and what better use of uranium other than nuclear power from Extreme Reactors. But Dr. Kronus, you ask, How can I store all these resources without having to make a vault of storage chests? Aha! the solution is elementary my dear player, this modpack has your back with Sophisticated Backpacks for your on-the go needs and Sophisticated Storage for your early to mid-game journey at your base. As you progress and want to store even more solids, want to now store fluids and add automated crafting to the mix, Applied Energistics 2 is going to be one of your friends.

Now that's all tech and dandy, but what about making the factory looking cool? Wellllll, this pack has you covered too. Ranging from day-to-day decor from MrCrayfish's Furnitures, to Macaw's various decor mods and so much more to explore.

Happy building ^_^
